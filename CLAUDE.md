# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Text tools is a React-based web application that implements a visual pipeline editor for text transformation. Users can create, organize, and execute JavaScript transformation steps in a drag-and-drop interface. The application is deployed to GitHub Pages and uses local storage for persistence.

## Commands

### Development
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install          # Install dependencies (pnpm 10.28.2+)
pnpm dev              # Start dev server on port 5173
pnpm build            # Type-check with tsc and build for production
pnpm lint             # Run ESLint
pnpm preview          # Preview production build
```

### Deployment
The application auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on push to master/main via `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`. The build sets `VITE_BASE` to `/<repo-name>/` for correct asset paths and copies `dist/index.html` to `dist/404.html` so deep links like `/pipeline/:id` work as an SPA fallback.

## Architecture

### Core Concept: Pipeline Execution Model
The application is built around a pipeline execution model where:
1. User input text flows through a series of JavaScript transformation steps
2. Each step receives the output of the previous step as `input`
3. Steps can be muted (skipped), reordered, or organized into pipelines
4. The pipeline auto-executes with a 20ms debounce after any change (input, code, or step order)

### Data Flow
```
main.tsx
  └─ PipelinesProvider     → shared pipelines + library + persistence
       └─ RouterProvider
            ├─ /                      → HomePage (list + create)
            └─ /pipeline/:pipelineId  → EditorPage
                 ├─ useSteps          → steps within active pipeline
                 ├─ useLibrary        → reusable step templates
                 ├─ usePipeline       → executes transformations
                 └─ useSearch         → filters pipelines/steps/library
```

### State Management
- **No external state library**: All state managed via React hooks + `PipelinesContext`
- **Routing**: `react-router` data mode; URL is source of truth for the open pipeline
- **Persistence**: App state serialized to localStorage as `StoredState` (pipelines, steps, library). `selectedPipelineId` is not restored — reopening always lands on home.
- **Storage keys**: Defined in `src/utils/constants.ts` with versioning support
- **Layout state**: Panel dimensions (sidebar width, library width, editor height) persisted separately

### Step Execution Environment
Steps execute in a sandboxed JavaScript context via `new Function()`:
- **Available globals**: `input` (string), `helpers` (utilities object)
- **Type hints**: Monaco editor configured with TypeScript definitions from `HELPERS_LIB` constant
- **Error handling**: Execution stops at first error, showing failed step and message
- **Helpers**: Currently provides `upper`, `lower`, `trim` (defined in `src/utils/helpers.ts`)

### Component Architecture
- **App.tsx**: Monolithic orchestrator component (1082 lines) that manages all UI state and coordinates hooks
- **Custom hooks** (`src/hooks/`): Extract business logic for pipelines, steps, library, execution, and search
- **Minimal components** (`src/components/`): Three presentational components for step items and droppable areas
- **Drag-and-drop**: Uses `@dnd-kit` for sortable steps and drag-to-library functionality

### Key Data Types (`src/types.ts`)
- `Step`: Individual transformation with id, title, code, muted flag, timestamps
- `Pipeline`: Named collection of steps with timestamps
- `LibraryStep`: Reusable step template (like Step but without muted flag)
- `StoredState`: Complete serializable app state (version 2)
- `RunScope`: Pipeline execution scope ('all' | 'from' | 'to') - currently locked to 'all'

## Important Patterns

### Monaco Editor Setup
The Monaco editor is configured once via `beforeMount` callback with a `didInitMonaco` ref to prevent re-initialization. TypeScript definitions for the step execution environment are injected via `addExtraLib()`.

### Debounced Pipeline Execution
Pipeline auto-runs after `BUBBLE_DELAY` (20ms) whenever input, steps, or scope changes. This is managed in `usePipeline.ts` via a `useEffect` with cleanup.

### Deletion Animation
Step deletion uses a two-phase process: mark as deleting (for CSS transition), then remove after animation completes. Tracked in `deletingStepIds` object.

### Resizable Panels
Three-column layout (sidebar | main | library) with draggable splitters. Resize state persists to localStorage. On narrow screens (<1024px), columns stack vertically.

### Drag-and-Drop Modes
- **Reorder steps**: Drag within step list (uses sortable context)
- **Save to library**: Drag step to library panel (uses droppable context)
- **Add from library**: Drag library item to step list (native drag-and-drop with JSON data transfer)
- **Reorder library**: Drag within library list (uses text/plain data transfer with `LIB_REORDER:` prefix)

## Development Notes

### Working with Steps
When adding step features, remember that steps execute sequentially and synchronously. Each step's return value becomes the next step's input. Muted steps are skipped entirely during execution.

### Adding Helper Functions
To add helpers available in step code:
1. Add function to `helpers` object in `src/utils/helpers.ts`
2. Update TypeScript definition in `HELPERS_LIB` constant in `src/utils/constants.ts`
3. Monaco editor will provide autocomplete for the new helper

### Storage Schema Changes
If modifying `StoredState` structure, increment `STORAGE_VERSION` and add migration logic in `loadStoredState()` (`src/utils/storage.ts`).

### Layout Customization
Panel dimensions and split positions are controlled by CSS custom properties (`--sidebar-w`, `--library-w`) set inline on the app container. Minimum dimensions are enforced during resize.
